# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## BRITTANIE'S NOTES:
```

Quick question: the first step of the hw says to edit the html document to contain more semantic elements. However, when I changed the elements, the entire css changes obviously. In Nic’s note in slack on Saturday he said that we didn’t have to touch the css document so I was confused then what to do about that step. Can you clarify for me and I can resubmit? 

```


## UPDATED Acceptance Criteria

```
Please focus on the following acceptance criteria:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
You can safely ignore the other two acceptance criteria, we will not use them when grading your submissions.
```
